# edWisor-Responsive-Design-Patterns-Assignment-Part-One

This repository is the part one of the second assignment of Level Frontend Design and Responsive web design. For this responsive
design patterns part, I approached a very popular and latest CSS layout property “flexbox”. I have described four different design 
patterns which we can achieve using responsive design and mobile first approach. 

Feeling good after making this type of stuff first time.
